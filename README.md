Linking migration typologies with spatial developments in Ulaanbaatar

As part of my PhD I am conducting a case study in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. As part of this study I aim to address
the dynamics of urbanisation by linking migration typologies (the demographic and socioeconomic life trajectories of
incoming migrants and residents) with spatial development (the longitudinal trajectory of what sort of dwellings they occupy
and how these change over time). Ulaanbaatar is a interesting place for such a study because its informal areas (ger districts) are made up of both built dwellings but also traditional ger sturctures (yurts), thus possesing a lot of variation in terms of spatial signature. 

This repository includes the scripts/rmd files used for planning the study, managing the data, and conducting the analysis.

It is all just in the works, so bear with me

This readme file also includes links to interesting open data that I either use or find relevant to the question of urbanisation in UB:

official statistics on UB: ubstat.mn
stats on mongolia in general: 1212.mn
