Understanding bottom-up spatial developments in Ulaanbaatar

As part of my PhD I am conducting a case study in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. With this study I aim to address
the dynamics of urbanisation by exploring the relationship between mobility, intended stay, investment, and the permanence of different types of dwellings. Ulaanbaatar is a interesting place for such a study because its informal areas (ger districts) are made up of both built dwellings but also traditional ger sturctures (yurts), thus possesing a lot of variation in terms of spatial signature. 

This repository includes the scripts/rmd files used for planning the study, managing the data, and conducting the analysis.

It is all just in the works, so bear with me.

This readme file also includes links to interesting open data that I either use or find relevant to the question of urbanisation in UB:

official statistics on UB: ubstat.mn
stats on mongolia in general: 1212.mn
