The creation of permanence: Household-level urbanisation processes in Ulaanbaatar

aka: UB-case-study

Informal intro:
As part of my PhD I am conducting a case study in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The research aims to address household-level urbanisation processes from a human behavioral ecology perspective, focusing on the strategic trade-offs households make between dwelling investment, mobility, and intended stay. This repository includes the scripts/rmd files used for planning the study, managing the data, and conducting the analysis.

It is all just in the works, so bear with me.

This readme file also includes links to interesting open data that I either use or find relevant to the question of urbanisation in UB:
